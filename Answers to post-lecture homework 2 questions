Question 6: When I interact with Chatbot, I find that Chatbot is able to respond to my questions quickly, and although it makes occasional errors, the general content is easy to understand.Chatbot is able to analyze your questions and extend the conversation, even if there are some topics you don't bring up. In my experience so far, Chatbot has been similar to a Q&A platform in terms of being a tool to help me understand the code, and I can find answers to any questions I have, even if the answers Chatbot provides are sometimes wrong.
